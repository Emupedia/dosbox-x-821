Notes for building under MSYS2/mingw-w64
1. autogen.sh is not working at all in MSYS2. Why?
2. Use these build flags:
	CFLAGS="-O3 -static" CXXFLAGS="-O3 -static -DHX_DOS" ./configure --disable-mt32
	CFLAGS="-O3 -static" CXXFLAGS="-O3 -static " ./configure 
	you need -static instead of --static.... options.
3. Under x86_64 mode, dynamic core is not building. It's a known problem in johncampbell123's original.
4. "sse2_unavailable" problem.
	fixed!
