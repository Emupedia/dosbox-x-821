# dosbox-x-821
yksoft1's testbed of Dosbox-X development. Branch of joncampbell123's Dosbox-X.

This is mostly used and built under MinGW, and don't expect a release at all as this repo only works as a testbed.
I'll apply patches of PC-98 emulation from joncampbell123's repository as soon as possible as I mostly use Dosbox-X as a PC-98 emulator.
